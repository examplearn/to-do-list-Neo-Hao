## What you will build

You will build a to-do list application inspired by https://todomvc.com/ in this project. Your to-do list applicaiton will allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The application will also allow users to track tasks by different categories. The categories, including _All_, _Active_, and _Completed_, are displayed as three buttons. Users can click on a button to view tasks in that category.

As you can imagine, as a user adds, checks, or deletes tasks, the tasks in each category will change. For example, if a user adds a new task, one more task will show up in the _All_ and _Active_ categories. If a user marks a task as complete, one more task will show up in the _Completed_ categories, but one less task will show up in the _Active_ category.

The application should be responsive and work well on mobile devices.
